# ⭐ Multimodal Health Diagnosis Using Deep Learning and Machine Learning
---

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **multimodal disease prediction system** that uses **ECG time-series data** and **patient vitals** to detect heart-related disease.  
Instead of relying on a single data source, the system combines multiple advanced machine learning models:

- **LSTM (RNN) model** for ECG heartbeat classification  
- **Machine Learning model (Random Forest)** for tabular vitals  
- **Fusion Neural Network** that integrates predictions from both models  

A **Streamlit-based web application** allows users to upload an ECG sample and enter health metrics to receive a final disease prediction.

## 🧠 Why Multimodal Learning?

In real-world medical diagnosis, doctors consider multiple inputs such as ECG rhythms, blood pressure, cholesterol, and patient history.  
This project mirrors that clinical workflow by fusing different data modalities, resulting in **more reliable and robust predictions**.
